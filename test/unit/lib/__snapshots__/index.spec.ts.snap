[json](https://rubygems.org/gems/json) is a JSON implementation as a Ruby extension in C.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS). When parsing certain JSON documents, the json gem (including the one bundled with Ruby) can be coerced into creating arbitrary objects in the target system.

This is the same issue as CVE-2013-0269. The previous fix was incomplete, which addressed \`JSON.parse(user_input)\`, but didn’t address some other styles of JSON
parsing including \`JSON(user_input) and JSON.parse(user_input, nil)\`.

See [CVE-2013-0269](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-RUBY-JSON-20060) in detail.

## Details

Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.

The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.

Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:
\`\`\`js
regex = /A(B|C+)+D/
\`\`\`

This regular expression accomplishes the following:
- \`A\` The string must start with the letter 'A'
- \`(B|C+)+\` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the \`+\` matches one or more times). The \`+\` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
- \`D\` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'

The expression would match inputs such as \`ABBD\`, \`ABCCCCD\`, \`ABCBCCCD\` and \`ACCCCCD\`

It most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:

\`\`\`bash
$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\\")'
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\\")'
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total
\`\`\`

The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.

Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.

Let's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \\"ACCCX\\". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:
1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.

The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.

From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.

| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |
| -------|-------------:| -----:|
| ACCCX | 3 | 38
| ACCCCX | 4 | 71
| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136
| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553


By the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.

[django](https://pypi.org/project/Django/) is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Directory Traversal. \`MultiPartParser\` allowed directory-traversal via uploaded files with suitably crafted file names.

## Details

A Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with \\"dot-dot-slash (../)\\" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.

Directory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:

- **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.

\`st\` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the \`public\` route.

If an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.

\`\`\`
curl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa
\`\`\`
**Note** \`%2e\` is the URL encoded version of \`.\` (dot).

- **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as \`Zip-Slip\`. 

One way to achieve this is by using a malicious \`zip\` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.

The following is an example of a \`zip\` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in \`/root/.ssh/\` overwriting the \`authorized_keys\` file:

\`\`\`
2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt
2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys
\`\`\`

## Remediation
Upgrade \`django\` to version 2.2.20, 3.0.14, 3.1.8 or higher.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Directory Traversal. \`MultiPartParser\`, \`UploadedFile\`, and \`FieldFile\` allow directory-traversal via uploaded files with suitably crafted file names.

## Details

A Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with \\"dot-dot-slash (../)\\" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.

Directory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:

- **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.

\`st\` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the \`public\` route.

If an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.

\`\`\`
curl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa
\`\`\`
**Note** \`%2e\` is the URL encoded version of \`.\` (dot).

- **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as \`Zip-Slip\`. 

One way to achieve this is by using a malicious \`zip\` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.

The following is an example of a \`zip\` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in \`/root/.ssh/\` overwriting the \`authorized_keys\` file:

\`\`\`
2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt
2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys
\`\`\`

## Remediation
Upgrade \`django\` to version 2.2.21, 3.1.9, 3.2.1 or higher.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to HTTP Header Injection. In Python 3.9.5+ urllib.parse() automatically removes ASCII newlines and tabs from URLs. Unfortunately it created an issue in the URLValidator. URLValidator uses \`urllib.urlsplit()\` and \`urllib.urlunsplit()\` for creating a URL variant with Punycode which no longer contains newlines and tabs in Python 3.9.5+. As a consequence, the regular expression matched the URL (without unsafe characters) and the source value (with unsafe characters) was considered valid.

This issue was introduced by the [bpo-43882](https://bugs.python.org/issue43882) fix.

[jinja2](https://pypi.org/project/Jinja2/) is a template engine written in pure Python. It provides a Django inspired non-XML syntax but supports inline expressions and an optional sandboxed environment.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). The ReDoS vulnerability is mainly due to the \`_punctuation_re regex\` operator and its use of multiple wildcards. The last wildcard is the most exploitable as it searches for trailing punctuation.

This issue can be mitigated by using Markdown to format user content instead of the urlize filter, or by implementing request timeouts or limiting process memory.

from jinja2.utils import urlize
from time import perf_counter

for i in range(3):
    text = \\"abc@\\" + \\".\\" * (i+1)*5000 + \\"!\\"
    LEN = len(text)
    BEGIN = perf_counter()
    urlize(text)
    DURATION = perf_counter() - BEGIN
    print(f\\"{LEN}: took {DURATION} seconds!\\")
\`\`\`

## Details

Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.

The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.

Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:
\`\`\`js
regex = /A(B|C+)+D/
\`\`\`

This regular expression accomplishes the following:
- \`A\` The string must start with the letter 'A'
- \`(B|C+)+\` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the \`+\` matches one or more times). The \`+\` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
- \`D\` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'

The expression would match inputs such as \`ABBD\`, \`ABCCCCD\`, \`ABCBCCCD\` and \`ACCCCCD\`

It most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:

\`\`\`bash
$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\\")'
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\\")'
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total
\`\`\`

The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.

Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.

Let's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \\"ACCCX\\". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:
1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.

The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.

From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.

| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |
| -------|-------------:| -----:|
| ACCCX | 3 | 38
| ACCCCX | 4 | 71
| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136
| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553


By the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.

[\`jinja2\`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jinja2) is a small but fast and easy to use stand-alone template engine written in pure python.
FileSystemBytecodeCache in Jinja2 2.7.2 does not properly create temporary directories, which allows local users to gain privileges by pre-creating a temporary directory with a user's uid.

**NOTE:** this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for [CVE-2014-1402](https://snyk.io/vulnSNYK-PYTHON-JINJA2-40028).

    "details": "## Overview
[jinja2](https://pypi.org/project/Jinja2/) is a template engine written in pure Python. It provides a Django inspired non-XML syntax but supports inline expressions and an optional sandboxed environment.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Sandbox Bypass. Users were allowed to insert \`str.format\` through web templates, leading to an escape from sandbox.
## Remediation
Upgrade \`jinja2\` to version 2.8.1 or higher.
